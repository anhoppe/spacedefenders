Remember the good times? YOU where in charge! No boss over your head, no control systems consuming your power. Only you and the aliens. Kill 'em all.

There are those cute fuzzy aliens on an alientarian rescue, peace and research mission. They came near earth and you spotted them.
Because of your awesome fire power and incredible senseless rage they try to escape immediatley with the rescued people and research results.

But not on your shift!

Only YOU can prevent the nice, harmless aliens from escaping earth. Kill or enslave as many of those succers as possible. Teach them a lesson about our race! KILL KILL KILL!!
